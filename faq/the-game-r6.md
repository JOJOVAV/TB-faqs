# The Game R6

## What crack files(plaza files) should I use?

Check the list.

Y1SX-Y6S2: Y1S0\_Vanilla - Y6S2\_NorthStar\
Y6S3: Y6S3\_BrutalSwarm\
Y6S4-Y8SX: Y6S4\_HighCalibre - Y8S2\_DreadFactor\


{% hint style="info" %}
Normally it should copy itself automaticly but it can always happen that it doesn't\
So always check if you have any .ini files in your game!
{% endhint %}

## How to launch said operation

RainbowSix.bat (just open it, to close it press any)

## My old Siege version opens the current version or Ubisoft Connect

Make sure to have exclusion in antivirus. Make sure to replace the crack in the root of the game.\
Download and replace the crack in the plaza folder.\
Place the Crack.zip in the cracks folder and extract it.\
Go to the correct crack copy the content and paste in game. (you don't need to copy the .ini files if you already have them)\
Folow the next steps 7 and 8 in[#downloading](../how-to-download.md#downloading "mention")

## My old Siege version is stuck preparing content, how do I fix it?

Close the game and restart it, if that doesn't work [verify your files](r6downloader-r6manifest.md#how-do-i-verify-my-game-files-and-what-is-the-meaning-of-verify)

## Why is my .exe/ launch application missing?

It didn't complete with the download, [verify your files](r6downloader-r6manifest.md#how-do-i-verify-my-game-files-and-what-is-the-meaning-of-verify)

It's also possible that you have a sku RUS version.\

## Why is my game crashing at the start screen (after pressing button)?

You didn't change your gamename, change it in the Codex.ini files, if you like to change your username it can be any name, check in the ini files (the ones that kind of resembles the name of crack to change it, codex.ini is were you change username too)
